# MinecraftWiimote

Is playing Minecraft with a keyboard and mouse too easy? Have you ever wondered what playing Minecraft on the Nintendo Wii would have been like? Well Look no further! This repository will let you play Minecraft (Java Edition or Bedrock) using a Nintendo Wii remote!

## System Requirements
1. Microsoft Windows 8 or newer
2. PC with Bluetooth 4.0 support (or newer)
3. A Nintendo Wii Remote with MotionPlus
4. Minecraft Java Edition or Minecraft Bedrock Edition

## Required Software
1. Carl Kenner's GlovePIE is the program we will use to translate Wii Remote inputs into keyboard and mouse inputs. Download GlovePIE from [my repository here](https://github.com/ravbug/glovepie). Follow the instructions there to download it. 
2. Download this repository as a ZIP by pressing the green Clone or download button at the top right of this repository.

## How to Use
1. aunch GlovePIE (press YES to administrative access) and open one of the three .PIE scripts.
2. Press the green Play button at the top of the GlovePIE window to start the script.
3. Ensure the lights on your Wiimote change. 
4. Alt-Tab to Minecraft and play!

## How to connect your Wii remote
1. Open Control Panel (NOT Windows 8/10 Settings) 
2. Press `Add A Device` Under `Hardware and Sound` ![Control panel section](https://i.imgur.com/rSvdYWW.png)
3. Repeatedly press the 1 and 2 buttons on your Wii Remote until your Wii remote appears. It will probably appear as `Input Device`. Select it. ![Input devices screen](https://i.imgur.com/1ISLEWS.png)

## Configure controls
1. The scripts have basic controls at the top of the file. Change the mappings to alter the controls. Review the [Wii remote page on the wiki](https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE/wiki/Wiimote-(Nintendo-Wii-Remote)) for a list of all the button mappings.
2. The scripts use motion controls in different ways. You cannot change easily what a particular script uses motion controls for. In the future I will address this.
